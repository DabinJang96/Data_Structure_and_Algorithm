Applied Algorithms and Data Structures for Engineers

Course Description
A good understanding of algorithms is essential to most engineering tasks today. Correct
implementations of algorithms have allowed the Internet to grow unbounded, computer games to
function in real time, and databases to be accessed quickly (and incorrect implementations have done
the opposite!).
